# obsy-web
Open Source Observatory Management Software (web UI)

This repository will contain PHP8 and SQL code used to run the OBSY observatory management system user interface. 
It communicates with the core OBSY database for configuration, task management, viewing results and image storage. 
The repository obsy-core is a Python based system that provides all low level functions for OBSY that must be i
nstalled seperately (and in fact doesn't even need to be on the same computer as obsy web).
